# Least-Squares Calculator

**Final Project — Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory**

This repository contains a **Least-Squares Calculator** developed as a final project for the *Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory* course. The application demonstrates how the **least squares method** is used to compute approximate solutions to overdetermined systems of linear equations using matrix operations.

## 📘 Project Overview

In many real-world problems, systems of linear equations do not have exact solutions because there are more equations than unknowns or because of inconsistent data. The **least squares method** provides an approximate solution by minimizing the squared error:

\[
\|Ax - b\|^2
\]

Instead of solving \( Ax = b \) exactly, the program finds a vector \( x \) that best fits the system in the least-squares sense using linear algebra concepts such as matrix transposition and multiplication.

## 🧠 Applications of Least Squares

This project applies least squares in the following ways:

### 📊 Data Fitting
Least squares is commonly used to find the best-fitting line or model for a given set of data points, especially when measurements contain errors.

### 🔢 Solving Overdetermined Systems
When a system has more equations than unknowns, an exact solution may not exist. Least squares provides a meaningful approximate solution.

### 🎯 Error Minimization
The solution minimizes the total squared difference between the predicted and actual values, making it useful in statistics, engineering, and machine learning.
